#This code writes a text in a current window. The text is taken from 'source.txt' file, which has to be created first.
#Useful script when traditional copy-paste does not work (CTRL+C and CTRL+V).
#note that you have to have pyautogui module installed in your IDE to run the script.

#Imports the libaries needed
import pyautogui
import time

#Opens the file in mode 'read' and after 3 seconds reads the text in the file and writes it in the open window.
f = open("source.txt", 'r')
time.sleep(3)
text = (f.read())
pyautogui.typewrite(text)
